# Assignment 2
This is an assignment from CSC108 at University of Toronto St. George campus and CSCA08 at Scarborough campus in Fall 2018.

I'm not a student in this course but I want to try it so I worked on it and finished it in one day.

This assignment is mainly about Python list operations, which I believe is very easy. But it seems to be hard for most of the first year students.
